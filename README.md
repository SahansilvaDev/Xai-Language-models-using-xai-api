Get Started With xAI: How To Make Your First API Call
 
 01 create Account (accounts.x.ai) 
 
 02 Creating your API key (getting in you console - console.x.ai) 
 
 03  Set it your environment variable in your terminal XAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"<br>
Variable name : XAI_API_KEY<br>
Variable value : "your_api_key_here"<br>

04 using this python file you can make your first x.api request using OpenAI SDK (docs.x.ai/api/integrations#openai-sdk)
(if you did not install openai use this in your terminal --- ( pip install openai ))
